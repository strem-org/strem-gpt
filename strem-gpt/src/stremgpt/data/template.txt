Positive Example:
Input: "Find a frame that contains a car."
Output: "[[:car:]]"

Positive Example:
Input: "Find a frame that contains a car followed by a pedestrian."
Output: "[[:car:]][[:pedestrian:]]"

Positive Example:
Input: "Find either a frame with a car or a frame with a truck."
Output: "([[:car:]]|[[:truck:]])"

Positive Example:
Input: "Find a frame with either a car or truck."
Output: "[[:car:]|[:truck:]]"

Positive Example:
Input: "Find a frame with a sign zero or more times."
Output: "[[:sign:]]*"

Postive Example:
Input: "Find a frame with a car and animal for one or more times."
Output: "[[:car:] & [:animal:]]{1,}"

Positive Example:
Input: "Find exactly five frames that contain a car."
Output: "[[:car:]]{5}"

Positive Example:
Input: "Find 5 to 25 frames where a bus and truck exist."
Output: "[[:bus:] & [:truck:]]{5,25}"

Positive Example:
Input: "Find a frame where a car and pedestrian intersect."
Output: "[<NONEMPTY>([:car:] & [:pedestrian:])]"

Positive Example:
Input: "Find a frame where the bounding boxes of car and pedestrian intersect zero or more times followed by a car or bus intersecting with a pedestrian for 1 to 10 times."
Output: "[<NONEMPTY>([:car:] & [:pedestrian:])]*[<NONEMPTY>(([:car:] | [:bus:]) & [:pedestrian:])]{1,10}"
